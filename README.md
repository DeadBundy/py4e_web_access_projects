Data structures: lists, dictionaries, tuples

File handling and parsing text files

Problem-solving, debugging, and code optimization

Organizing projects and version control with Git & GitHub

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/DeadBundy/py4e-DSA-projects.git
Navigate to the scripts folder:
cd scripts/DSA
Run any Python script:
python filename.py
Ensure the data folder is in the same directory as your script if it reads input files.

💡 Tips for Learners
->Break problems into smaller steps
->Test with different edge cases
->Debug strategically and iterate
